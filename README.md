# HCP_Diffusion_Scripts
repository of scripts for processing the HCP data

After downloading and unzipping the HCP data it should have a folder set up like this:

- subject_number:
  - release-notes
  - T1w
    * Diffusion
    * T1w_acpc_dc_restore_1.25.nii.gz

If it does not then you may need to edit the first script for the correct folder set up
